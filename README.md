# Linear-Regression

This repository involves a comparison between two Linear regressor, a version implemented from scratch and another implemented using scikit-learn module.
---
This notebook is divided into two main parts:
 - Simple linear regression
 - Polynomial regression

In each part, I'll implement a from-scratch version and a sklearn-implemented version of both linear and polynomial regression. then I would compare the results of both versions (by results, I mean the value of the final cost estimated on test data).
